# TREK

TREK is a web application that displays deals on travel packages. 

You will build a single page application that will query data from an api, using AJAX, to display a list or trips and view more information on a specific trip. While viewing a specific trip, you can claim your spot by sending data back to the API. 

All of this should be done without ever having to reload the page. 

## The API

View the [Travel API's documentation](https://github.com/PilgrimMemoirs/trip_api). 


## Minimum Requirements 
  - **Wave 1** Click button to show all trips
  - **Wave 2** Can click on trip to see more information about that trip
  - **Wave 3** Within the trip show, can reserve a spot


## Optional Enhancements
  - **For more practice with showing a list of Many Trips**, Show trips by search queries (like by continent, budget, etc.). Will need to explore API to see what functionality exists. 
  - **To practice a more advanced POST**, Setup the functionalit to create a new trip. 
  - **For more JQuery Practice**, Use Jquery to resort list of trips by specific attributes, like budget or time remaining. 
  - **For an extra challenge**, Have the number of spots available update on a page automatically if another user were to reserve a spot while you were viewing that trip.
